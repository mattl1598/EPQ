uses an neural processing unit (NPU)
built into the Kirin 970 chipset which also contains the CPU (central processing unit) and IGP (integrated graphics processor)

an npu is designed with artificial intelligence in mind which means it is much more powerful in AI tasks than the CPU's and GPU's that were available at the time of launch.

camera improvements using ai:
uses the npu to adjust settings in the camera app by analysing the image to correct exposure and focus in order to improve the photo being taken.
the npu can also be used to more easily recognise the subject of the photo to make the photo look better, for example if the phone recognises food being in front of the camera, it will up the contrast and saturation to make the dish look more appealing and for animals, it knows to focus on fine details of the creature to make the shot appear more true to life.
the npu can also be used to identify the subject and apply a bokeh depth-of-field effect to image. by using the ai, the phone can do most of the processing after the image has been taken by identifying the edges of the subject and blurring the outside.
