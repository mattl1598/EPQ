# Introduction

# Hardware enabled AI devices
## Huawei Mate 10 Pro
One consumer device that utilises hardware based AI is the Huawei Mate 10 Pro smartphone.
To power the AI, it uses a uses a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) built into its chipset, the Kirin 970, which also contains the CPU (Central Processing Unit) and IGP/GPU (Integrated Graphics Processor/Graphics Processing Unit).
An NPU is designed with artificial intelligence in mind which means it is much more powerful in AI tasks than the CPU's and GPU's that were available at the time of launch.
The main marketing point for the AI in this phone is the smart camera adjustments based on what the sensor is being pointed at. The phone uses the NPU to adjust settings in the camera app by analysing the image to correct exposure and focus in order to improve the photo being taken.
The NPU uses AI powered object recognition to easily recognise the subject of the photo and make adjustments to make the photo look better, for example if the phone recognises food being in front of the camera, it will up the contrast and saturation to make the dish look more appealing and for animals, it knows to focus on fine details of the creature to make the shot appear more true to life.
The NPU can also be used to identify subject of a portrait style photo and apply a bokeh depth-of-field effect to the image keeping the person in focus and making the background blurry. By using the AI, the phone can do a lot of the processing after the image has been taken by retro actively identifying the edges of the subject and blurring the outside.

The second main use that is targeted towards the consumer is the use of the NPU to manage resources more efficiently. This means it can keep the phone cool whilst charging to protect the battery and give it a longer life. By managing the resources properly, it can also prioritise foreground processes which will make the phone feel snappier to the user.
The NPU is also utilised in translation because of its power when analysing large amounts of data to gather more from context when there are multiple translations of a word so that a more understandable translation is produced.

# Software/cloud-based AI

some artificial intelligences are not powered by the device they appear to be running on. these AI's are usually based in "the cloud" or on a server in a large data-center somewhere else in the world and the client device sends commands to the servers AI so that it can respond.
common applications of these cloud AI's are in low power voice interactive speakers such as the Amazon Echo line up and Google Home products. These smart speakers have basic commands for various activities including:
* music playback,
* making to-do lists,
* setting alarms,
* streaming podcasts,
* playing audiobooks,
* providing weather, traffic, sports and news
* searching the web for information and reading out the results



another place a cloud based AI is likely to be found is on a smartphone in the form of a "virtual assistant". These can usually do the same things as a smart speaker with many more commands available with the addition of a screen and a sim card. These additions include:
* opening applications
* playing movies and tv shows through popular media streaming sites
* plan routes with directions for navigation
* sending texts and starting calls.
