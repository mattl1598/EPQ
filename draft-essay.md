# Introduction

# hardware enabled ai devices


# software/cloud based ai

some artificial intelligences are not powered by the device they appear to be running on. these ai's are usually based in "the cloud" or on a server in a large datacenter somewhere else in the world and the client device sends commands to the servers ai so that it can respond.
common applications of these cloud ai's are in low power voice interactive speakers such as the Amazon Echo line up and Google Home products. These smart speakers have basic commands for various activities including:
* music playback,
* making to-do lists,
* setting alarms,
* streaming podcasts,
* playing audiobooks,
* providing weather, traffic, sports and news
* searching the web for information and reading out the results



another place a cloud based ai is likely to be found is on a smartphone in the form of a "virtual assistant". These can usually do the same things as a smart speaker with many more commands available with the addition of a screen and a sim card. These additions include:
* opening applications
* playing movies and tv shows through popular media streaming sites
* plan routes with directions for navigation
* sending texts and starting calls.
