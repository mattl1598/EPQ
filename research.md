### Cloud Based AI services

#### Amazon Alexa
* [Main wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa)

* Virtual Assistant developed by Amazon
* First used on Amazon Echo and Echo Dot smart speakers
* Can be used for
  * music playback,
  * making to-do lists,
  * setting alarms,
  * streaming podcasts,
  * playing audiobooks,
  * providing weather, traffic, sports and news
